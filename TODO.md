## THOUGHTS

- I want to do a Platform layer like the Handmade Hero,
  what I think I should do is provide an command buffer
  that we build of commands that replicate the
  raylib API (as needed). Then I can swap it out later
  if I have something I like. This existed in the Zig
  version, but also want this for the Odin version
